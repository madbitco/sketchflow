# Sketchflow

A simple Alfred workflow for quickly locating and opening Sketch files

## Why is it worth my time?

If you use Sketch, you may have stumbled upon a daunting process of getting to open your recently modified designs as quickly as possible. For those of you who use [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com), I created a simple workflow which will help you get to your local design files much faster.

## How to install?

1. Make sure Alfred is installed and its Powerpack unlocked
2. [Download Sketchflow](https://github.com/matthewmorek/sketchflow/releases/latest)
3. Double click the `.alfredworkflow` file to add it to Alfred
4. Enjoy!

## How to use

1. Bring up Alfred (using assigned hotkeys; I use `⌘ + Space`);
2. Type in “sketch”, tap spacebar to display a list of recently opened files;
3. Start typing your query to see a list of matching files;
4. Pick a file and hit `⏎` (return) to open it, or hold `⌘` while doing so, to reveal the selected file in Finder;
5. Et voilà!
